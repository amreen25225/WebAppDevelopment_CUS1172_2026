    <h1>Interests:</h1>
    <p>
        In my free time, I love to spend quality time with my friends and family. I love being able to see my family and spend time together by doing things such playing card games, watch TV shows together and just have an overall good time. I also love to do self care activities such as get my nails done, and relax. In addition, I also love going to the gym and running. This keeps me active and is a great way to relieve stress. I am always interested in ways to better myself.

   <h2>Favorite Movie:</h2>
   <p>
    Ever since I was little, one of my favorite movies to watch was <strong>Tangled</strong>. I watched it very often as a kid and always enjoyed it. It is truly a beautiful story that I enjoy watching over and over again. Down below is the official trailer for the movie.

  <h2>Favorite TV Show</h2>
  <p>
    My favorite TV show at the moment is <strong>Smallville</strong>. Even though I just started the third season, I love the plot of the show as well as how the love story between Clark Kent and Lana Lang is developing. I also love how Clark Kent is is learning how to deal with his special powers in a way that is secretive yet so helpful to multiple characters on the show. He constantly saves peoples lives and protects them from danger. This show always has my interest and makes me excited to see what happens next.

<h2>Favorite Website:</h2>
<p>
    One of my favorite websites to visit and spend my free time on is Instagram. I love being able to stay up to date with all of my friends and what they are doing. I also love to see the beautiful photos that everyone posts. This is special to me because I am also able to keep in contact with all of my family that lives all over the world. Another main reason I love Instagram is because I love getting ready and taking pictures, resulting in a nice and asthetic Instgram feed.
